## Eden Lake (2008): When Bad Parenting Goes Catastrophically Wrong

There are horror movies that leave you satisfied, and then there are horror movies that leave you wanting to throw something at the screen while yelling obscenities. Eden Lake is firmly in the latter category, and not because it's bad - because it's infuriatingly good at making you absolutely furious.

This is one of those high-anxiety horror films where you spend the entire runtime yelling at the screen, frustrated as hell, knowing that usually these movies end with the bad guys getting what's coming to them. Except Eden Lake doesn't give you that payoff. At all. And that's what makes it so rage-inducing.

The premise is simple: Jenny (Kelly Reilly) and Steve (Michael Fassbender) go on a romantic weekend camping trip to a quarry that's being developed. Steve has an engagement ring and plans to propose. Instead, they encounter a group of teenagers led by Brett - an absolute sociopath in the making - who escalate from obnoxious harassment to full-blown torture and murder.

From the very beginning, the film telegraphs its thesis through talk radio playing in the car: parents need to be held accountable for their children's behavior. That's the entire point of this movie, and it drives it home brutally by the end.

The weekend goes wrong immediately. Their bed and breakfast is a disaster. They witness a mother violently smack her kid in public. When they go to town for breakfast and Steve complains about the teenagers harassing them, the waitress gets hostile and snaps "not my kids" - an immediate tell that she's connected to the problem, even though she has no idea what's really going on.

Every adult in this movie is absolute garbage. The parents don't discipline their kids - they ignore them, abuse them, and create little monsters. Brett's house has a door with a fist-sized hole punched through it. His father smacks him in the face. These kids are growing up in an environment of violence and neglect, and it shows.

The teens start with typical obnoxious teenager behavior - loud music, letting their dog terrorize Jenny, being dicks. Steve refuses to be run off by them, which is understandable. At that point, we'd probably dig our heels in too - fuck them, we're not leaving. But Jenny keeps suggesting they should just go, and in hindsight, she was absolutely right.
Things escalate when the teens steal Steve and Jenny's car. Steve confronts them to get it back. A fight breaks out and Steve accidentally kills Brett's dog. That's the point of no return.

Brett forces the other teens to torture and kill Steve. He ties Steve to a tree stump with barbed wire and makes each kid take turns stabbing him.

 Some are hesitant. Some throw up. But Brett orchestrates everything like Charles Manson, making sure everyone participates so they're all complicit. He even records it on his girlfriend's phone for insurance.
Here's the most disturbing part: Brett never actually does the killing himself. He threatens, manipulates, and forces everyone else to do it while keeping his hands technically clean. It's calculated sociopathy from a teenager who clearly learned it from his family.

Jenny spends a lot of the movie hiding, which was frustrating as hell to watch. She camps under a tree all night instead of using the darkness to get help. She watches the torture happening to Steve instead of running for help immediately. It drove us crazy because there were so many opportunities where she could have done something different.
But eventually she shifts into fight mode. She makes a weapon and when one of the younger teens approaches her, she stabs him in the neck without hesitation. She survives impossible odds - a spike through her foot, hiding in a dumpster full of rotting sludge, being hunted through the woods. She even runs over one of the teens with a car.
Kelly Reilly is phenomenal. Her screams are visceral and believable. When she's in pain, you feel it. The scene where she has to push the spike through her foot using a log is excruciating to watch, and she sells every second of it.

It looks like she might actually make it. And that's when the movie pulls its cruelest trick.

Jenny crashes a car and stumbles into a house party, covered in blood and filth, begging for help. Someone tends to her. Gives her tea. Tells her she's safe.
Then she realizes she's in Brett's house. At his family's party. The waitress from the restaurant is there - she's Brett's mother. Brett's father is there - the same man who nearly caught Steve breaking into their house earlier.

The parents get a phone call. They're being told their version of events - that this woman killed Cooper, one of the kids. When Brett arrives and they ask if Jenny is the one, he nods. They believe their son without question. They don't ask for details. They don't call the police to sort it out. They just believe Brett's version and decide to handle it themselves.

Brett's father says "we take care of our own here" and drags Jenny into the bathroom while she screams, trying to explain what really happened. No one listens.
Brett goes upstairs, deletes all the incriminating videos from the phone, and stares at himself in the mirror. Maybe seeing the monster he's become. Maybe just admiring his handiwork. The movie ends.

This ending split us completely.
For one of us (Talon), this ending is absolutely infuriating. Brett gets away with everything. Multiple murders. And his family - who don't know what he really did - believe him instantly and eliminate the problem rather than getting authorities involved. Jenny is killed by adults who blindly protect their child without asking questions. The lack of payoff, the lack of justice, the fact that Brett just walks away unpunished - that knocked the rating down significantly. Six and a half cents out of ten.

For the other (Dan), the bleak ending is exactly why the film works. Life isn't like that. Life doesn't always have sunshine and roses and neat endings where the good guy wins. People get away with terrible things, especially when they have family willing to protect them without question. The ending is intentionally uncomfortable because it reflects reality - sometimes there is no justice, and that's genuinely horrifying. Seven and a half cents out of ten.

That's the real horror of Eden Lake. Not the violence. The parents.

The film's entire point is that terrible parents create terrible kids. Brett learned violence from his father. He learned that his family will always protect him no matter what, no questions asked. When confronted with Jenny's accusations against his son, Brett's father doesn't even consider she might be telling the truth. He just eliminates the problem.
This is a cycle that will never end. Brett will grow up to be his father. He'll have kids. He'll abuse them. They'll do terrible things. The family will cover for them without asking questions. Generation after generation.

The movie itself is well-made, well-acted, and genuinely tense. The cinematography creates beautiful contrasts between serene nature and brutal violence. The performances are all convincing, especially Jack O'Connor as Brett playing casual sociopathy with chilling confidence.

This is worth watching if you can handle extreme frustration and zero feel-good vibes. It's a brutal examination of how cycles of violence and negligence perpetuate across generations. It shows parents who have raised their kids so badly that when their child says someone hurt them, they don't call the police - they just handle it themselves with violence, never questioning whether their kid might be lying.

But fair warning: if you need your horror movies to have satisfying endings where evil gets punished, you might want to skip this one. One of us wanted to throw something at the TV when the credits rolled. The other appreciated the unflinching bleakness.

Either way, you won't forget it.
